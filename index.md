Hi! My name is Seoyeon Park, and I'm Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My main research interests span artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and natural language processing,  with applications to text and social network analysis.  In particular, I'm interested in improving machine learning architecture for transfer learning and multitask learning in natural language understanding tasks such as empathy detection, text classification, and scholarly domain keyphrase extraction/identification, classification, and generation.
